			<hr>
			<p>Ventura County is generally separated into two major sections, East and West County. The East County is at a significantly greater elevation than the rest of the county, and includes Thousand Oaks, Santa Rosa Valley, Lake Sherwood, and Newbury Park, among other areas.</p>
			<p>The West County primarily consists of beach communities, and as such sees a greater rate of tourism than the East County.</p>
