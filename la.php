			<h4>Reasons to Visit</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>Among such attractions as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Los Angeles Zoo, and the Natural History Museum, Los Angeles County features a huge number of wonderful attractions.</p>
			<p>Alongside the manmade features of the area, Los Angeles is also home to the La Brea Tar Pits, a group of tar pits in Hancokc Park, from which natural asphalt has seeped up from the ground for tens of thousands of years. The La Brea Tar Pits are mainly utilized for scientific purposes, such as the excavation of the remains of animals trapped there hunreds, or thousands of years ago. Many such subjects can be found in local museums, such as the Columbian mammoth skeleton currently on display in the George C. Page Museum.</p>
